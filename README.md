# Using 3Dtbd assets in Procedural Worlds Products

The [Procedural Worlds](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/15277) suite of products are designed to help you build worlds for your games. This project provides configurations and extensions to make this easier to do with the open source 3Dtbd assets. For example, you can find [Gaia](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/gaia-terrain-scene-generator-42618) resource packs and [GeNa](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/gena-2-terrain-scene-spawner-127636) spawners.

# Getting Started

Clone this repository and open the project in Unity. This will automatically install the 3Dtbd asset packages.

You will find Procedural Worlds configuration files in the `Assets/OpenSourceConfigurations` folder.

It is outside the scope of this document to provide tutorials for the use of these assets in those tools, we recommend you review the excellent online tutorials for these assets. There are some demo scenes in the `Assets/Scenes` folder.

# Scripts

In the `Scripts` folder you will find useful scripts for working with Procedural Worlds assets. Such a Pegasus Triggers, GeNa Extensions and more.

# Contribution

We welcome contributions of new configurations for Procedural Worlds products, as well as other assets.
