# Procedural Worlds Integrations

This folder contains various resource files that make it easier to work with these models inside the [Procedural Worlds](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/15277) suite of products. For example, you can find [Gaia](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/gaia-terrain-scene-generator-42618) resource packs and [GeNa](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/terrain/gena-2-terrain-scene-spawner-127636) spawners.

It is outside the scope of this document to provide tutorials for the use of these assets in those tools, we recommend you review the excellent online tutorials for these assets.
